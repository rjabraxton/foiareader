Brown, Mayor Wheeler, President Peterson, and Chair Kafoury, this is Pastor J.W. Matt Hennessee. We all know our nation, our world, our State, our County, our Region, our City is in serious trouble. Another unarmed Black man is killed in Atlanta tonight. Are we ready to mobilize a 'Call to Repentance and Renewal'? I will ask the Ecumenical Ministries, Inter-Faith Peace & Action Collaborative, the Common Table and other faith based, civil and human rights organizations to bring this to fruition but we need someone dedicated from each of your offices. If we don't act intentionally and courageously what is happening will only get worse. White allies/leaders and Grass Roots leaders and members must stand with us and help us project the fact that we want to end the scourge of racism and not just in the law enforcement. This 'Call' is a start but we need you, all faith    leaders, leaders of business, the criminal justice system, and others. We will get no help from President Trump and he is not an authentic leader in this lane anyway,  but all of you are. We must be intentional and resolute. I love each of you and I believe in you. We must not assume the cancer of racism which is rampant in all institutions will go away on its own. It won't. We cannot assume police brutality is all we are dealing with. It's not; it's much bigger than that. I'm asking you for one person from each of  your organizations to work with us. If you have questions or hesitation  let me know. If you are with me, let me know that as well. Blessings to each of you, Matt\"","time":"2020-06-14T11:12:06.999Z"}],[{"sender":5038102006,"text":"\"Count us in. Thank you, Pastor Hennessee.
