O. v. Eli Franklyn Richey (DeVore, J.)    Respondent, a self-identified citizen journalist and police watchdog, appeals a judgment and stalking protective order (SPO) prohibiting contact with petitioner, a police chief. He contests the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the SPO, arguing that the SPO erroneously relied on constitutionally-protected speech, and that petitioner failed to prove that her alarm was objectively reasonable. Held: The record contains insufficient evidence to permit issuance of an SPO. Petitioner offered three potential contacts to support her request, two of which involved expressive communication and nonexpressive conduct that failed to meet the respective standards for causing objectively reasonable alarm. Because the first two encounters cannot 4 serve as requisite contacts, the record contains insufficient evidence of repeated unwanted contacts, regardless of whether the third incident could    qualify.

I hope you are doing well! As you know, our fall conference is scheduled on the 11th and 12th of September. Due to a presenter cancellation on the afternoon of the 11th, I am looking for a strong two-hour presentation and thought an after-action briefing from PPB on the August 17 protests would be great (preparation, use of force tactical, media/press, partnerships, etc). I&apos;m sure you have some great takeaways and footage. The presentation could be just PPB or you could include partners (feds, etc.). It would be from 2:00 to 4:00.
