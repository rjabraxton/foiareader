You are our Mayor. You have done an extraordinary job. In your re-election narrative please consider expanding your focus beyond homelessness/houselessness and include bridge building and healing between communities of color, initiate a drive (that can be a model to other Mayor's) toward eradicating racial and gender disparities, and an economic development/recovery plan insuring all people thrive. Just my unasked for two cents. Blessings to you, Matt \"","time":"1970-01-01T00:00:43.979Z"},{"sender":5038236773,"text":"\"Good thoughts Matt.
